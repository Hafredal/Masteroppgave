\noindent
At St. Olavs Hospital nurse calls are delivered to nurses through a wired and wireless system. The handling of nurse calls are an important part of nurses work, and this activity requires a high degree of collaboration and coordination among nurses to ensure efficient and qualitative care.
Still previous research has found that how, and to which extent the systems are used varies throughout the hospital, which may imply that the systems are not used as intended.

\noindent
The purpose of this project is to identify these variations and understand why they occur through an ethnographic study of nurses interactions with the systems, at three departments at St. Olavs Hospital. 

\noindent
The research questions that we seek to answer are (a) How does the use of the systems vary internally, and between the different departments at the hospital? And (b) Which factors may be the cause of these variations?
